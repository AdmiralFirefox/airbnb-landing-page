                &quot;Hosting has been so rewarding and life-changing. It&apos;s
                allowed us to pursue our passion for interior design and helped
                us realize our niche—that we really love renovating spaces for
                others to enjoy.&quot;

                &quot;As a designer, I find that I remember spaces even more
                than conversations. I love the idea that so many other people
                can make memories here, and that the stuff I fill my house with
                sparks something. It makes me so happy.&quot;

                &quot;Airbnb has become an integral way I practice my

                &quot;Hosting gives us the opportunity to design houses for
                ourselves. It gives us a chance to try ideas that we can use on
                projects for our clients. We've landed quite a few jobs from
                guests who stayed at our place.&quot;
